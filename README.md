# Trello Clone

This project is about creating a clone of Trello, with no need for login.
It should support the basic functionality of Trello in the browser.

### The requirements

- The design should be as close as possible to Trello (You may use Themes from Bootswatch).

- It should be responsive.

- You should be able to create multiple boards.

- Each board can have multiple lists.

- Each list can have multiple cards.

- You should be able to modify (rename, edit, delete) all of the boards, lists, cards.

- Cards should be draggable, so you can drag and drop cards from list to another (Check libraries for such functionality), it should require no refresh for moving from list to another.

- You may use `json-server`, `localStorage`, **Firebase** or any other persistent data storage that fits you.
